  Alas, turning the other cheek just gets you slapped! 
  If you cooperate & they defect, you lose a point while they gain three.

  Sure, seems like the right thing to do... OR IS IT?? 
  Because if you both cooperate, you both give up a point to gain three. 
  (score: +2 vs +2) But if you defect & they cooperate, you gain three points at their cost of one. 
  (score: +3 vs -1) Therefore: you "should" still DEFECT.

  Wow, that's mean... and also the correct answer!
