  You have one choice. In front of you is a machine: if you put a coin in the machine,

  Alas, turning the other cheek just gets you slapped!

  Sure, seems like the right thing to do... OR IS IT?? 
  Because if you both cooperate, you both give up a coin to gain three.

  Wow, that's mean... and also the correct answer!
